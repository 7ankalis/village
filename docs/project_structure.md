## Building Instructions

### Prerequisites
- CMake (version 3.10 or higher)
- C++17 compatible compiler (GCC, Clang, or MSVC)
- Git (for cloning the repository)

### Build Steps

#### Linux/macOS
1. Clone the repository (if you haven't already):
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/VillageGame.git
   cd VillageGame
   ```

2. Create a build directory and navigate to it:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p build
   cd build
   ```

3. Generate the build files using CMake:
   ```bash
   cmake ..
   ```

4. Build the project:
   ```bash
   make
   ```

5. Run the game:
   ```bash
   ./game
   ```

#### Windows with Visual Studio
1. Clone the repository (if you haven't already)
2. Open the folder in Visual Studio with "Open Folder" option
3. Visual Studio should automatically detect the CMakeLists.txt and configure the project
4. Build the project using the Build menu or by pressing F7
5. Run the game by pressing F5 or through the Debug menu

#### Windows with CMake GUI
1. Clone the repository
2. Open CMake GUI
3. Set the source directory to the repository root
4. Set the build directory to a new folder (e.g., build)
5. Click "Configure" and select your compiler
6. Click "Generate" to create the project files
7. Open the generated project in your IDE and build

### Troubleshooting
- If you encounter missing header files, ensure that your IDE or build system correctly includes the `include/` directory
- For compilation errors related to C++17 features, verify that your compiler supports C++17 and is correctly configured
- If certain source files appear to be missing during compilation, check that all source files in the `src/` directory are included in your build

### Project Structure

## Game Overview

VillageGame is a console-based strategy game where players build and defend a village against incoming enemy attackers. The player controls a builder character who can move around the map, construct different types of buildings, collect resources, and strategically defend their town hall from enemies that spawn at the edges of the map.

### Core Game Mechanics

- **Resource Management**: Collect and spend gold and elixir to build structures
- **Building Placement**: Strategically place defensive walls and resource-generating buildings
- **Enemy Defense**: Defend against different enemy types with varying behaviors
- **Turn-Based Gameplay**: Enemies move and attack when the player takes movement actions

## Game Loop

The main game loop in `main.cpp` orchestrates the game flow:

1. Initialize the game board and input manager
2. Enter main loop:
   - Render the current game state
   - Get player input
   - Handle input (move player, place buildings, collect resources)
   - Update game state (spawn enemies, update resources)
   - Repeat until player quits or game over

The game uses a turn-based system where enemies only move or attack when the player takes a movement action.
